    "# Introduction to the problem\n",
    "The following scenario is purely fictional and is intended to interest people in the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assume that you are running a website where people can post reviews of drinks such as wine, beer, and spirits (whiskey, gin etc). As an administrator of the website you want to keep things transparent and the reviews objective, so you only allow the reviewers to taste and review only one kind of drink; some people will specialize only on wine, some only on beer and some only on different spirits. However, you (the administrator) are growing suspicious that there are some reviewers who are cross drinking and posting reviews for other drinks. You want to stop this behaviour but you don't want to piss off your tasters because they are good at their job, so you hire a data scientist to build an ML model to identify tasters who are cross drinking and reviewing other drinks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain we are working on is a corpus of wine and beer reviews collected from a website called [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/). The writers of our corpus are people who review and rate wines, beers and spirits professionally. Some of these tasters specialize on one drink (most of them in wine) and some others embrace cross drinking and delve into other beverage categories.\n",

    "# Problem methodology\n",
    "This notebook will focus on building a machine learning model, trained on wine reviews, to recognize tasters who are cross drinking and reviewing other beverages. The model will be evaluated against a collection of beer reviews where it will try to identify tasters based on their unique style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on some thorough inspection of the data, we saw that there 19 wine tasters, 2 beer tasters and 1 spirits taster. The 2 beer tasters also review wines, so they are the people we would like to identify. The problem, then, boils down to a binary classification problem. We will use the wine dataset and the spirits dataset and we will train a model to identify two categories, **wine_taster** and **spirits_taster**."
